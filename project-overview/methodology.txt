I. Review sessions
  a. Conduct an initial design session to determine intitial features
    i. Define overall user goals
    ii. Define an initial task list, with priorities of importance
    iii. Design a preliminary user interface
  b. conduct build-review sessions after every sprint before starting a new sprint
    i. Test software as user
    ii. Take notes and comments on observations or problems occurred during the test
    iii. Revise goal list
    iv. Revise and preoritize task list
    v. Revise user interface changes 
II. Artifacts
  a. Goal list
    i. One, or more, tasks will be derived from each goal
    ii. Each individual goal should be phrased as a complete sentence and user verbs like "allow, provide, enable"

    iv. Tasks will be assigned a priority of either: H (high), M (medium), L (low)
    v. Must be able to answer why a feature will be in the system before adding it to the task list
    vi. Must be able to answer how a feature will be used before adding it to the task list
  c. Code
    i. Use IDE with code completion support
    ii. Follow conventions for formatting of code to make code consistent
    iii. Choose meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables to improve readability
    iv. Comment classes and methods appropriately
    v. Write a failing test before writing just enough code to allow test to pass, then refactor code before moving to a new test
    vi. Maintain a to-do list that mirror the task list
III. Sprints
  a. Perform 1 week sprints
    i. Tasks to be performed in a sprint are decided before the sprints begins
    ii. No new tasks will be added to a sprint once it is in progress
    iii. Any remaining tasks unfinished will be moved to the next sprint
